# UnderGMX
A C# Program which takes input from https://github.com/WarlockD/GMdsam and makes it into a GMX Project. (wip)

To use compiled version, put the executable in the same folder where the folders with extracted content are. (GMdsam)
Run the executable. It should make a UnderGMX.gmx folder and inside has the project file.
WARNING: Errors may occur in GM:S, just dismiss all of them for now. Also, there are unused variables. I know.
